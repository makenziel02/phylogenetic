# phylogenetic
During a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in the summer of 2024, I researched evolutionary relationships among a genus of dragonfly. 
I observed morphological characters using a scoring system and used ancestral reconstruction analysis to determine how closely related the species in the genus were. 
I worked with a team of researchers and used this R code to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on the morphological characters observed. 
After reconstructing the trees, model selection statistics were calculated and the one with the lowest AICc value was used as the best model and published.
