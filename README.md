# Ancestral Reconstruction Analyses using Phylogenetic Tree
During a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in the summer of 2024, I researched evolutionary relationships among a genus of dragonfly. 
I observed morphological characters using a scoring system and used ancestral reconstruction analysis to determine how closely related the species in the genus were. 
I worked with a team of researchers and used this R code to reconstruct phylogenetic trees based on both the morphological characters scored and the phylogenetic tree that was reconstructed using anchored hybrid enrichment data. 
After reconstructing the trees, model selection statistics were calculated and the one with the lowest AICc value was used as the best model and published.

This figure was then created by a team member to display the ancestral reconstruction of the six characters as they evolved among species. The clades are highlighted according to geography, with red corresponding to Eurasia, blue corresponding to western North America, and yellow corresponding to eastern North America. The tips shown in gray depict missing scores.
